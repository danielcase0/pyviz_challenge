## Summary

This repository contains the files for the module 6 homework assignment: PyViz challenge.

## File description

### Primary Code

All of the relevant code can be found in the Jupyter notebook titled "san_francisco_housing.ipynb", which is located in this folder.

### Data Files

All of the data files can be found in the Resources folder:

- neighborhoods_coordinates.csv

Note: The third data file that was provided (housing_per_year.csv) wasn't used in the analysis, so I haven't included it here.
